Hello and welcome! I’m Dr. Jasmine Baker, a scientist deeply passionate about genomic variants and their potential to transform healthcare. Through the power of computation, research, and scientific communication, I strive to make a lasting impact on precision medicine and population health.

My journey in the world of bioinformatics began with a Ph.D. in Biological Sciences from Louisiana State University, where I studied the evolution of Alu elements in primates. Since then, I’ve had the privilege of working with renowned institutions like Baylor College of Medicine and SomaLogic, where I’ve led initiatives in predictive modeling, disease analysis, and genomic data interpretation.

Currently, as a Staff Scientist at Baylor College of Medicine, I focus on curation and guidelines for hereditary cancer interpretation, collaborating with expert panels under the ClinGen framework. I am also dedicated to training the scientific community in variant classification and gene curation, with the goal of continuously advancing our understanding and application of genomic knowledge to improve healthcare outcomes.

Beyond my research, I’m deeply committed to fostering collaboration and knowledge-sharing in bioinformatics. Whether through workshops, conferences, or mentorship, I aim to engage in meaningful scientific communication that shapes the future of genomics and computational biology. Through this platform, I share my research, discuss emerging trends, and provide resources for those seeking to understand the transformative role of variants in medicine.

Thank you for visiting my site. I invite you to explore my work, engage with the content, and join me in advancing healthcare through the science of genomics.
