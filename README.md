My name is Jasmine Baker, PhD. I am currently a postdoctoral associate at Baylor College of Medicine and an aspiring Data Scientist. My PhD was focused on mobile elements and comparative genomics. Currently, my research is focused on sickle cell disease.

I am getting back into the swing of Python programming and beginning to dabble in other languages. I will upload old codes from my PhD along with new projects as they progress. I am looking to collaborate on translational, genomic or evolutionary biology projects. I am also open to mini projects focused on big data!
