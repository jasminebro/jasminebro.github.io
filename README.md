My name is Jasmine Baker, PhD. I am highly motivated scientific communicator with a PhD in Biological Sciences with a focus on Genomics and Bioinformatics. I have 10+ years of scientific research experience. I love translating complex scientific concepts into clear and concise communication for 
diverse audiences. I have extensive hands-on experience in life science research techniques (PCR, Next-Generation 
Sequencing, etc.) and data analysis using Python and R. I am passionate about teaching, mentoring and
assisting others in resolving technical challenges.
